# 🌿 Intent-Garden (S-OAK)

	"We don’t predict the future of AI. We enforce its Intent."

Welcome to the *Intent-Garden*, a research and engineering collective dedicated to *Deterministic AI*. We are building the infrastructure for an era where AI-generated code is no longer a liability, and hardware is no longer a bottleneck.

## 🏗️ Our Core Philosophy: Deterministic AI

Modern AI is a "Stochastic Parrot"—powerful but chaotic. At *Intent-Garden*, we believe that mission-critical systems (Streaming, MedTech, Aerospace) cannot rely on probability alone.

We solve the AI Trust Gap through a three-layer stack:

1. *Symbolic Intent (Lisp/Clojure):* The "Constitutional Law" of the system.
2. *The Enforcer (Babashka/Clang AST):* A deterministic gatekeeper that audits AI-generated code against formal logic.
3. *Neuromorphic Execution (Decima8):* Parallel, probabilistic hardware governed by symbolic constraints.

## 🛠️ Key Projects

## 🛡️ Garden-Core

The heart of our S-OAK (Symbolic Oracle & Architecture Kernel) workflow.

 - *Target:* Saving *C* and *Linux Systems* from "Academic Bloat" (Rust).
 - *Stack:* Clojure/Babashka + Clang AST.
 - *Method: Garden-Tagging.* We use AI as a laborer to annotate code, while our Lisp-based Enforcer validates every pointer, mutex, and memory boundary with zero runtime overhead.

## 🐉 Decima8

Our "Dragonfly" project. A Neuromorphic IDE and Emulator for SRAM-memristor clusters.

 - *Goal:* Moving beyond the Von Neumann bottleneck.
 - *Concept:* A probabilistic neural engine where "synaptic growth" is governed by *Intent-Garden* contracts. It’s a biological machine with a Lisp-based DNA.

## 📜 The "Hacker's" Manifesto

 - *Intent over Syntax:* We don't care how the code is written, as long as it satisfies the Intent.
 - *Rules over Chaos:* We don't try to make AI "smarter"—we make it compliant.
 - *C over Rust:* We preserve the speed of the "Old Steel" by shielding it with "Modern Logic."
 - *Pragmatism over Academia:* We are builders, not linguists. If it doesn't work on an *i5-3550*, it doesn't work.

## 🤝 Join the Garden

We are looking for *System Architects, Lisp Hackers*, and *C-Veterans* who are tired of "Vibe-Coding" and ready for *Deterministic Engineering*.

 - *Step 1:* Define your Intent.
 - *Step 2:* Tag your Code.
 - *Step 3:* Enforce the Law.

"The Era of the Black Box ends. The Era of the Intent-Garden begins." 🌿🛡️🇨🚀
