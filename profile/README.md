# 🌿 Intent-Garden (S-OAK)

	"We don’t predict the future of AI. We enforce its Intent."

Welcome to the *Intent-Garden*, a research and engineering collective dedicated to *Deterministic AI*. We are building the infrastructure for an era where AI-generated code is no longer a liability, and hardware is no longer a bottleneck.

## 🌱 The Open Experiment

Intent-Garden is an open community effort. We believe that safety in the AI era should not be a corporate secret. We invite hackers, systems engineers, and hobbyists to contribute to our Global Intent Registry. Let’s save the "Old Steel" (C/Linux) together.

## 🛠️ The Open Ecosystem

### 🛡️ [Intent-Garden (S-OAK)](https://intent-garden.org)
**The Symbolic Engine.**
A Clojure-based enforcer that audits AI-generated C/C++ code. It uses **Garden-Tagging** to bridge the gap between Stochastic AI and Deterministic Logic.

### 📖 [Rule-Rom](https://rulerom.com)
**The Global Intent Registry.**
An open-source library of architectural "Best Practices" stored as **EDN/Markdown** contracts. From Memory Safety to Financial Compliance—if it's mission-critical, it belongs in Rule-Rom.

### 🖼️ [LibWUI](https://libwui.org)
**The Semantic Interface.**
A modern C++ UI library managed by Intent-Garden. It serves as our primary testbed for enforcing thread-affinity and memory-safety in complex graphical systems.

## 🏗️ Our Core Philosophy: Deterministic AI

Modern AI is a "Stochastic Parrot"—powerful but chaotic. At *Intent-Garden*, we believe that mission-critical systems (Streaming, MedTech, Aerospace) cannot rely on probability alone.

We solve the AI Trust Gap through a three-layer stack:

1. **Symbolic Intent (Lisp/Clojure):** The "Constitutional Law" of the system.
2. **The Enforcer (Babashka/Clang AST):** A deterministic gatekeeper that audits AI-generated code against formal logic.
3. **libWUI:** Ultra-lightweight C++ visualization engine for telemetry systems.

## 📜 The "Hacker's" Manifesto

* **Intent over Syntax:** We don't care how the code is written, as long as it satisfies the Intent.
* **Rules over Chaos:** We don't try to make AI "smarter" — we make it compliant.
* **C over Rust:** We preserve the speed of the "Old Steel" by shielding it with "Modern Logic."
* **Pragmatism over Academia:** We are builders, not linguists. If it doesn't work on an *i5-3550*, it doesn't work.

## 🤝 Join the Garden

We are looking for *System Architects, Lisp Hackers*, and *C-Veterans* who are tired of "Vibe-Coding" and ready for *Deterministic Engineering*.

* **Step 1:** Define your Intent.
* **Step 2:** Tag your Code.
* **Step 3:** Enforce the Law.

"The Era of the Black Box ends. The Era of the Intent-Garden begins." 🌿
